Im have a bacherlors in Biology and a MsC in Biodiversity and Systematics with a focus on population genetics and plants taxonomy. I am currently in the final stage of my PhD.
___
### Undergraduate Degree
During my undergraduate degree, I gained experience in scientific research, statistical methods, data manipulation, and visualization using R and Python. I also participated in various congresses and workshops to broaden my knowledge and skills.
___
### Master's Degree
Later, during my master's degree, I worked with genetics and molecular markers to study evolution and population genetics in wild plants. I focused on delimiting closely related species and how hybridization and morphological traits impact the evolution of plants.
___
### Ph.D. Degree
Now, in my Ph.D., I am immersed in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data to perform genome assembly, target capture, and genome annotation for evolutionary and population genomics analysis in tropical trees. My research examines the evolution and biogeographic history of endangered species and how this information can impact conservation efforts. I have also collaborated with colleagues on projects related to population genomics and conservation.

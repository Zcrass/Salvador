# Hello wolrd!

My name is Salvador 
I am a Ph.D candidate at Instituto de Ecologia A. C. with a passion for bioinformatics, evolutionary genomics, populations genomics, and genomic data science. My professional journey started in biology, with a focus on plant biology and traditional uses. However, I soon discovered my interest in bioinformatics and molecular evolution and how genetic and genomic data can teach us about organisms biology and can be used in conservation efforts.

## Education
___
### Undergraduate Degree
During my undergraduate degree, I gained experience in scientific research, statistical methods, data manipulation, and visualization using R and Python. I also participated in various congresses and workshops to broaden my knowledge and skills.

### Master's Degree
Later, during my master's degree, I worked with genetics and molecular markers to study evolution and population genetics in wild plants. I focused on delimiting closely related species and how hybridization and morphological traits impact the evolution of plants.

### Ph.D. Degree
Now, in my Ph.D., I am immersed in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data to perform genome assembly, target capture, and genome annotation for evolutionary and population genomics analysis in tropical trees. My research examines the evolution and biogeographic history of endangered species and how this information can impact conservation efforts. I have also collaborated with colleagues on projects related to population genomics and conservation.

## Experience
___
My experience includes working both in field and laboratory, as well as programming in Python and R and using various bioinformatic tools to process and analyze high-throughput sequencing and population genomics data. Aditionally I have worked in projects that involved Machine Learning and clustering methods as well as spatial analysis and Geographic Information Systems.

Bellow you will find a brief description and links to projects that I have worked on in recent years.

### [Analysis of HTS data]()
Analysis of High Throughput Sequencing Data from the quality check of the raw reads to the assembly of complete chloroplast genomes and nuclear targets. This project Makes use of different bioinformatic command line tools in a Linux Conda environment.

### [Introduction to population genomics in R]() (*In development*)
A series of introductory analysis of population genomics using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data and different R packages. 

### [Ancestry prediction in R]()
Prediction the ancestry of individuals using a series of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and SNP data. This version was developed in the R programing languaje.

### [Ancestry prediction in Python]()
Second version of the Ancestry prediction analysis. Prediction the ancestry of individuals using Machine learning algoriths in Python.

### [SDM using ML in Python]() (*In development*)
Generating Species Distribution Models using machine learning and bioclimatic data in python.

### [Bigdata prossesing]()
Prossesing bigdata info using Python, Dask and Pandas.

### [Angiosperm Metagenome]() (*In development*)
Testing a metagenome extraction pipeline from GBS sequencing data.

### [QGIS workshop]()
Introductory workshop into the use of QGIS software to produce figures and maps for research papers.
